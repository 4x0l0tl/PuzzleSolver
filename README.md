# PuzzleSolver
Simple Java application to solve a colour placement puzzle

## Motivation
![Puzzle Box Cover](/images/cover.jpg "Puzzle Box Cover")
My first attempt to solve this puzzle was when I was around 6 and it was busted out on a visit to my great aunts house, with the promise of £20 if I managed to solve it.

The puzzle was published by an Irish company that appears to have been around between 88 and 94

## Starting Point

## Unique Piece Types

Though there are 16 pieces to place, but there are only 9 unique piece types.
This would be a good optimization to take into account in future

## Algorithm
A recursive depth first search algorithm seemed like the simplest solution to implement
